        <h3>Weekly quizzes</h3>

        <h3>Lab exercises</h3>
        <p>In the tutorial, your tutor will review the completion of your completed lab exercises. You are encouraged to attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so you have time to discuss any issues that arise with your tutor and get them marked off.</p>

        <h3>Assignments: Parts 1, 2, and 3</h3>
        <p>These are incremental installments of a web site development task.
